Uses the JSON-Simple library:
- Can be downloaded from http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjsonsimple11jar.htm
- Take the Jar and add it as a library to the project

Uses JUnit 5.3 as a testing library.
- Intellij is able to add this to the class path using Maven when using 'alt + enter' on the unknown @Test
- For uses such as AT, BDD, Algorithm or Evaluation, this library is not required.

Algorithms:
- Algorithm: Contains the Algorithm implementation

AttackTree:
- AT: AT representation
- Ordering: Ordering of BASs

BDD:
- BDD: BDD representation and construction from AT
- Subsuming: Subsuming implementation

Examples:
- ATExamples: Loads AT examples from JSON

JSON:
- Contains AT examples from literature or for testing in JSON format

Permutations:
- Permutation: Class to obtain permutations of a single set of BASs
- Permutations: Used to obtain permutations of an attack

Structures:
- AttackTree: Structure classes for the AT representation
- BDD: Structures classes for the BDD representation
- Traversal: Structure classes for the BDD traversal

Tests:
- PermutationTest: Tests permutation class
